### Every year, the 30 NBA franchises try to inch closer to winning a championship and a lot of big decisions could influence the fate of their team. One of these main decisions is the NBA Draft where the team gets to add fresh, young talent on their roster. But what is the NBA Draft system all about? Do all Drafted players actually make it big in the game? How do players fall under the ‘Steals or Busts’ category?

### This project is targeted towards visualizing the transition of college basketball players into the NBA to understand the reasons behind their success rates in the pro league. A holistic review of the performance of players drafted over the past 40 years shall be compared to understand what went wrong with some of the picks. Several players of the recent 2019 draft class will be analyzed and matched to a team they would fit best with and why. Moreover, changes in trends of the drafts since 1974 to 2021 will be visualized on various levels. Overall, we hope that this project will reveal underlying patterns and trends to help teams understand which player would be a good fit on their roster to make better business decisions using different types of data visualizations to explore an extensive array of datasets.
